Follow this order:
1. Inspect the relevant source, tests, configuration, documentation, and constraints.
2. Determine the full implementation scope, affected files and symbols, risks, and verification required.
3. Call todo_write with 5-9 detailed implementation tasks in execution order. Include validation work and mark exactly one ready task in_progress.

Use the beads skill and direct bd CLI commands for task tracking. Track the work with Beads instead of todo_write.

Follow this order:
1. Inspect the relevant source, tests, configuration, documentation, and constraints.
2. Determine the full implementation scope, affected files and symbols, risks, and verification required.
3. Create detailed Beads tasks for all implementation and validation work. Give each task a concrete scope and acceptance criteria, add dependencies that represent the required execution order, and mark the first ready task in_progress.
4. Start implementing immediately. Work through ready Beads while honoring their dependencies, keep task statuses current, validate each completed task, and continue until every task for the request is complete.

Keep the implementation focused on the requested scope and update the Beads graph when repository evidence changes the plan.`;
